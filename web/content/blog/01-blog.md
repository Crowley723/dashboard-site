# Welcome to my blog!

After suggestions from some of my friends, I have decided to add a blog to my website.
The goal here is to discuss technical (or maybe less technical) topics that I am currently learning about, am working with, or other miscellaneous topics.

This website is build using the following technologies:
- React + Typescript: I had my first experience with React when I started contributing to the [Authelia] open source project. Since then, I have not done any web development in plain HTML, JS, and CSS and prefer to use more structured frameworks.
- Go: Same story, my first exposure to [Go] was working on the Authelia project and my experience thusfar has been extremely favorable.

This blog is built using the following packages:
- [Grey-matter]: Used for parsing the frontmatter (think metadata) from the blog post files (which are written in markdown). This allows me to define things like post titles, dates, and descriptions in the blog post file and be able to reference it from the frontend.
- [Markdown-it]: This is the meat and potatoes, it is a markdown parser that supports advanced features such as language syntax highlighting, footnotes, and more.
- [React Markdown]:
